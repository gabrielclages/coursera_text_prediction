# Coursera Data Science Capstone - Text Prediction Algorithm
## Creating a Shiny App to predict text

This study is part of a coursera peer-graded assigment of Data Science Capstone.

In this project we will use data science tools to create a web based text prediciton algorithm.

In this repo you can find reproducible R-scripts used in the analysis.
